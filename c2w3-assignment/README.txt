this is a c++ implementation of the inverse kinematics,
made for ModernRobotics speicalization, course3,
modified to log iterations, and local variables required.

# code
the .cpp file only contain the IKinBody function as required in the assignment, to find the complete source code to run this function, i have written a whole library for the specialization in c++, and you can find it here https://github.com/ertosns/kinetics

# csv
the output of this function is output.csv, and it print out the name of the variable in one line, then the values on the following lines such that each row is spread out in a single line in csv, the whole file follows csv standard.

# for python/matlab/mathematics peer reviewers
- the naming is made the same as per the documentation, so even if you don't understand c++ you can read the functions names, and match it with your own implementation, otherwise, download the whole source code from the give url above, and execute it
